i want to know if my essay is good enough for a high school level

Hello there, folks! Greetings from the land of VJIT College, where we're not just teaching students to read, but to also decipher the secret language of social media and its unpredictable effects on our brains!

Hey, I'm Kautilya, your friendly neighborhood essay-writer. I've dabbled in the realm of 500 words, exploring the thrilling tale of "The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health." Now, I find myself in a rather peculiar predicamentâ€”I need to know if my masterpiece is ripe for the consumption of high school minds!

So, here I am, quaking in my boots, wondering if my attempt at dissecting this digital labyrinth has managed to avoid the pitfalls of oversimplification or, worse, boring my audience to tears. I'm eager to hear your thoughts, dear human judges, on whether I've managed to strike that perfect balance between complexity and accessibility for the young, impressionable minds of high schoolers.

Can you, with a straight face and a twinkle in your eye, tell me if my 500-word essay is fit for their delicate mental palates? Please, enlighten me on this matter of great importance!

Kautilya, VJIT Coolege

P.S. If anyone can help me find a way to make a parody of 'The Lord of the Rings' using only emojis, I'd be eternally grateful.
